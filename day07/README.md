## 19. saveFaces.py

This python script takes a folder with images as an input and it outputs cropped images of the faces found in all of the multiple inputs and stores them into a folder.

## 20. faceRecognition

Here we train a model that learns to recognize Mars and Cafe (my nickname). Trained with thousands of images of our faces taken from videos. 
The proccess of getting the images was easy due to the previous script that stores only the faces of those who appear on the video/image. Props to my gf for helping!
