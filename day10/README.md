## 25. backgroundSubtractor

We make use of the different background subtractors that openCV has and use them to detect movement on a video! This aproach of course is 100x times better than the one we did on day 4.

Making use of the background subtractor, now we use it to detect movement on a specific area on a crowded mall.
